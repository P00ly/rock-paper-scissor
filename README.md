## Overview: 
This is my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project emulates the game of rock, paper, scissors. Here you play against the computer where the first to 5 wins. You play by simply clicking on the image of 
the object you want to select. If you win, a message appears in the DOM and the counter increments by one. If you and the computer select the same objects, 
a message appears letting you know it was a draw. And if you lose the computers score increments by one. 


## Features:
- Click to choose object
- on hover, the scale of the item you hover over scales to give responsiveness
- On a win, a message appears and the border of the selected object glows green
- On a loss, a message appears and the border of the selected object glows red. 
- On a tie, a message appears and the border of the selected object is grey

## Tools:
